Though they admit guilt, the perpetrators cannot explain their motives, just that the urge to kill felt as matter-of-fact as turning on the lights in a dark room. The trail leads Takabe to a mysterious young man named Mamiya who claims amnesia and displays an inability to form fresh memories, but harbors a dark secret. Spoilers follow.\n\nMamiya’s secret is that he’s a master of mesmerism, planting hypnotic suggestions to kill in his victims. He uses things like a lighter’s flame or running water to lull his victims into a hypnotic state.\n\nWriter-director Kiyoshi Kurosawa weaves these triggers into the film’s presentation, planting pendulums, railway signals, sirens, flickering lights, and flowing water into shots, sometimes as the focus, but often as subliminal background elements. The soundtrack hums with the perpetual white noise of dryers, clanging metal, and industrial drone.\n\nTakabe seems immune to Mamiya’s powers, fascinating Mamiya. This leads to an elliptical plot where Takabe pursues Mamiya to destroy him, but ends up becoming him.\n\nMaybe.\n\nKurosawa’s original plot synopsis ended with Takabe on the beach displaying signs of memory loss similar to Mamiya. This would have taken the film full circle, but somewhere in the development process Kurosawa embraced the unreliable narrator.\n\nBy the time Takabe sets out in pursuit of the escaped Mamiya, we’re unsure if what we’re watching is real or imagined. One could make the case we’re watching an illusion meant to distract Takabe while he commits atrocious crimes. Consider how, in a 2022 interview, Kurosawa, referring to the ending, says Takabe may be a criminal.\n\nLike the best of David Lynch’s films, it invites rewatches to uncover its mysteries. Like the worst of David Lynch’s films, it has no definitive solution to be found.\n\nAs a quasi-remake of God Told Me To, the film improves on the original by focusing on the police procedural elements exploring the horror inherit in otherwise sane people committing unexplained acts of hideous violence.\n\nBut like God Told Me To, Cure struggles with the payoff. Positing Mamiya as “a missionary sent to propagate the ceremony” proves full of possibility, but Kurosawa’s decision to tie this to Franz Mesmer disappoints. Mesmer and his animal magnetism theories don’t inspire fear or even curiosity.\n\nBut more beyond the Mesmer connection, I struggled with Mamiya’s motives. If he’s a missionary, why the random killings? If he’s out to kill, why be so sloppy about it? Why the amnesia angle?\n\nHere’s my take. The mesmeric cult sought to relieve people of their mental burdens by freeing them to act on their darkest desire—murder. In removing the associated guilt, it allowed the hypnotized subject to move past that emotional blocker. It doesn’t plant the urge so much as remove the inhibitions and associated remorse.\n\nThis dovetails with Takabe’s arc, where he’s torn between loving his ill wife, and resenting the burden her care imposes. Mamiya can’t “cure” Takabe because of these dual identities. Yet, for Takabe, the urge to purge both identities and be “empty” like Mamiya proves irresistible.\n\nThus, I read the ending as Takabe having killed his wife and unified his self. This brings him his much sought-after tranquility, as evidenced by his well-groomed appearance, relaxed demeanor, and empty plate. As part of his “cure” he’s become the new missionary, out to help others, starting with his waitress, who we see grasp a cleaver and stalk across the restaurant before the film cuts to credits.\n\nThis almost fits. Except some of Mamiya’s victims display intense guilt and remorse—consider the schoolteacher who kills his wife and the businessman who kills the prostitute. Is the message that Mamiya’s “cure” isn’t for everyone? Perhaps, but that weakens the film’s nihilistic premise. Further, there’s the matter of Takabe’s friend, the psychology professor. What was his “cure”? There’s an angle that Takabe might have killed him, but it doesn’t fit.\n\nI’m not saying I need everything spelled out. Consider The Endless. It leaves a lot unexplained, but you have a sense that if you asked the directors about this or that bit, they’d have a concrete answer.\n\nI’m not so sure with Cure. Kurosawa seems more interested in atmosphere and tone. To this end, it’s reminiscent of David Lynch’s more frustrating entries. Close to greatness but lacking that tangible narrative thread.\n\nI’m surprised this flew under my radar for so long. The nihilistic plot and trap movie overtones land it right in my wheelhouse. It didn’t work for me, but I appreciate the craftsmanship at work and hope a future viewing reveals more depth.\n",["Date","2023-05-16T00:00:00.000Z"],"\u003Cp>Detective Takabe investigates a growing series of murders where the perpetrators carve a large “X” into their victim’s throats.

A supernatural trap has Holden struggling for his life, only escaping once Karswell enters and turns on the lights. Karswell treats the intruding Holden as one would treat a party guest who’d gotten lost looking for the bathroom.

His skepticism is our skepticism. But this falls apart when we know Karswell’s powers are real from the outset. Instead of questioning things along with Holden, we grow impatient waiting for him to catch up with what we already know.\n\nWe can thank producer Hal E. Chester for the degradation.

He investigates a Caribbean dictator, Kananga, played by Yaphet Kotto, who has ties to a Harlem gangster named Mr. Big. Jane Seymour plays Solitaire, Kananga’s tarot card reading psychic.\n\nAfter reading and watching Casino Royale, I decided to continue the series in publication order.\n\nThis will be new for me. I saw A View to a Kill and every subsequent Bond film save No Time to Die during its original theatrical run. But I caught the earlier films in haphazard order. The Connery entries proved easy to arrange in my head. Post Goldfinger, each film sees the camp increase in inverse proportion to Connery’s hair.\n\nBut the Moore films always confused me. It wasn’t until I spent two weeks watching all the Bond films in chronological order that I realized the more minimalist For Your Eyes Only came between the kitchen-sink Moonraker and Octopussy.\n\nLive and Let Die proved another odd entry. I knew it was early in his run, but it wasn’t until the chronological rewatch that I realized it was Moore’s first. Like Craig and Brosnan, Moore steps into the role with confidence, his years spent on The Saint television series having prepared him.\n\nHis Bond proves lighter, more gentlemen than man’s man, and his one-liners prove droll compared to Connery’s sarcasm. Thus, he’s closer to the Bond of this film’s source novel.\n\nBut this proves the extent of this adaptation’s similarities. The film eschews the novel’s pirate treasure angle (smart) and adds the Kananga character (not as smart). The fictitious San Monique replaces Jamaica, and New Orleans replaces Florida. Bond’s casual racism is gone, but so too are the novel’s subtle digs at the plight of black Americans. Instead, the film plays to Blaxploitation tropes, with Mr. Big’s henchmen attacking Bond in a pimpmobile.\n\nJane Seymore works as Solitaire, but has little to do. Ditto David Hedison as Felix Leiter, who I liked in the role, even if his hair resembles a toupee.\n\nThe film jettisons the train journey and underwater infiltration mission that comprise the bulk of the novel’s second and third acts. In their place, we get a pair of chase sequences. In the first, Bond escapes Kananga’s island compound via a double-decker tour bus which he bisects via a low bridge. He and Solitaire then flee to New Orleans, where he’s captured again. Kananga attempts to feed him to some crocodiles in a terrific sequence that may have inspired the Atari game Pitfall, but Bond escapes again, this time via speedboat. This chase proves the film’s centerpiece, proffering some memorable stunt work. It also introduces the racist Sheriff J.W. Pepper, who returns in the next entry, The Man with the Golden Gun.\n\nThe finale sees bond infiltrate Kananga’s supervillain compound in San Monique. In a pleasant change, he wields a Colt Magnum hand cannon. I also loved how Kananga provides his compound henchmen matching embroidered polo shirts. After some questionable logic involving Bond’s gadgets, and a fight scene so outrageous even Moore grins during one shot, it’s all over.\n\nThis entry hasn’t aged well. Aside from the terrific theme song, nothing resonates. The narrative stakes never engage. Even the speedboat chase feels drawn out. The best I can say is that Kotto delivers the appropriate charisma and personality even though he lacks the physical stature.\n",["Date","2022-07-01T00:00:00.000Z"],"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Roger Moore’s James Bond debut.\u003C/strong> He investigates a Caribbean dictator, Kananga, played by Yaphet Kotto, who has ties to a Harlem gangster named Mr. Big.
